# VBA - AutoGen - Functional specification 
## Introduction
This code is used to auto generate templated documenation to quickly and repeatedly instantiate functional specification documents. This code was built with the assistated support from T.Newbury.


## Langauges
VBA
SQL

## Required Files
1. SSFS_Builder.bas (Main)
2. AssetSpecificFunction.bas
3. DatabaseConnection.bas
4. DocumentTools.bas
5. Logging.bas
6. SSFS_Template_v01.docx

## Thoughts for improvements
I would ideally like to move this project to a python based code to improve execution time and improve portability/useability in the future.
